Our goal is to provide cost-effective prosthetics to allow all disabled person to keep their standard of living after losing a limb.\r\n\r\n## Biotekk Prosthetic Arm\r\nThe aim of the prosthesis is to prevent any struggle that an amputated limb poses on one’s daily life. A missing body part not only inhibit people from their basic pursuits of happiness, but also obstruct them from any kind of activity, and a loss of independence. In order to restore the basic rights of humans, teams of 2 to 4 will create a prosthetic arm. The arm must cost below a $80, include an Arduino component, and possess at least 2 fingers. By applying the 6-step engineering design process, our team gathered research from the internet and prosthetists. We researched past MESA and Arduino designs, as well as simple prostheses that amputees currently use. Our team then decided to create a fixed cardboard/wood-based claw attached to a wooden compartment in between. A machine screw would be screwed into the wooden part and connected to a servo. The servo will then rotate in either direction depending on the user’s input to operate the arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem statement\r\nCurrent prosthetic arms are too expensive, weak, and fragile for common use.\r\n\r\n##Prototype\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n### Kentaro V. - [kvadney3@gmail.com](kvadney3@gmail.com)\r\nAspiring Entrepreneur, Engineer, and athlete.
